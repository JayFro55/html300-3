SEO stands for search engine optomization which is the relevancy of your page in a search engine. This is incredibly important because in this day and age people more often than not look things up using Google. Your pages traffic can be highly dependent on how highly your page is optomized. Therefore to improve SEO multiple things should be considered. The page must be indexed to be included in Google's search results. There should be many links in places. What also really helps is having articles written that include your pages name in the title.
